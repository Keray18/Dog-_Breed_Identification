## Dog_Breed_Identification üê∂
### Created Machine Learning model on a Multi-Class Classification problem. The data used here is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.



## Build on MobileNet-v2
### Used `mobilenet-v2` which is a convolutional neural network that is 53 layers deep.It is a general architecture and can be used for multiple use cases.
